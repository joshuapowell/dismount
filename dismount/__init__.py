"""System Logging.

System logging enables us to retain useful activity within the system in
server logs. Log messages are written to the Terminal or Application Runner
(e.g., Supervisor) server logs.

Below sets up the `basicConfig` which opens a stream that allows us to add
formatted log messages to the root logger.

@param (object) logger
    Provides the ability to write directly to the logger with the info(),
    warning(), error(), and critical() methods

See the official Python::logging documentation for more Information
